# Smart Home Projects
This is a collection of my home automation/smart home projects, integrated into Apple HomeKit, using [HomeSpan library](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan) on ESP32.

1. [Fireplace switch](fireplace_switch/README.md). A smart relay for controlling thermocouples fireplaces, or really anything you might have.
1. [Contact sensors & temperature and humidity sensor](doors_and_windows/README.md). A security system for monitoring status of doors and windows, and a wireless temperature and humidity sensor. It's two unrelated features smashed together.
1. [Garage door opener](garage_door_opener/README.md). This project turns a dumb garage opener into a smart one, integrated with HomeKit, and with online logging.
1. [ESP8266 based switch](esp8266_switch/README.md). A simple smart switch based on ESP8266, a deviation from ESP32.
