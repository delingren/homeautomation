# Temperature and Humidity Sensor

## Goal

## Hardware
* The sensor I bought: [AcuRite Wireless Indoor Outdoor Temperature and Humidity Sensor (06002M)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T0K8NXC). It transfers data over the [standard LPD433 band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPD433).
* 433 Mhz receiver.
* Microcontroller. I already have an ESP32 running to monitor the contact sensors on the doors and windows. So I'm piggybacking on that MCU.
